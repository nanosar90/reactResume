            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am an active duty Navy Sailor and have been working in Nuclear Power for the last ten years.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>I have been fascinated by the growth of technology and computers over my career and it has inspired me to seek out a career in the software engineering and web development following my Naval career. I am currently scheduled to get out of the Navy in July of 2022 and look forward to using my skills in the field. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I began coding by myself and began furthering my education with the Washington Javascript Full Stack Flex course in January of 2021. Following that I took the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy course through Navy Skillbridge where I furthered my cloud devolopment and administration. </p>
